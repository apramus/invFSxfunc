# Data from 

Ramus AP, Silliman BR, Thomsen MS, Long ZT (2017) An invasive foundation species enhances multifunctionality in a coastal ecosystem. *PNAS* (In Press).

This respository contains the plot-level data used to generate all analyses and figures presented in the paper. We plan to update it to include the corresponding R codes used for analyses at some point the future.

### 1. Data
See the paper for a detailed description of the experiment and methodologies used. These data represent the time-averaged value of each variable measured monthly in each plot over the course of the 10 month experiment. A brief description of each variable is given below. The suffix `.sr` denotes supporting responses only measured near the end of the experiment.

`Plot` the experimental plot, numbered from West to East

`TrtPeg` the density treatment in total number of u-pegs assigned to each plot

`Gcvr` the average *Gracilaria* cover (%) maintained in each plot over the course of the experiment

`Epi` mean abundance of epifauna (# m^-2)

`EpiRich` mean richness of epifauna taxa (taxa m^-2)

`Dsln` mean chalk dissolution expressed as mass lost in grams per day (g d^-1)

`DslnFlip` mean reflected chalk dissolution

`Sed` mean sediment stabilization expressed as the change in height in cm per month (âˆ†cm mo^-1)

`Nrsy` mean abundance of nursery species (# m^-2)

`NrsyRich` mean richness of nursery taxa (taxa m^-2)

`Dcmp` mean decomposition of *Spartina* stems expressed as mass lost per month (g mo^-1)

`Infa.sr` mean abundance of infauna (# L^-1)

`InfaRich.sr` mean richness of infauna taxa (taxa L^-1)

`Rays.sr` mean number of ray holes (# m^-2 d^-1)

`RaysFlip.sr` reflected mean number of ray holes

`Wfwl.sr` mean abundance of waterfowl (# m^-2 h^-1)
